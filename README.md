# Practicum Tool

This is a web-based tool developed as part of my System Development course to manage and organize student placements. 
It includes features for admins, instructors, and students, with preloaded sample data to demonstrate core functionality.

## Test Accounts

The database comes preloaded with three user accounts:

| Role       | Email                 | Password   |
|------------|-----------------------|------------|
| Admin      | admin@email.com       | Password1! |
| Instructor | instructor@email.com  | Password1! |
| Student    | arden@email.com       | Password1! |

## Sample Data

- Two student sample lists are already inserted into the database:
  - One for **Saint John**
  - One for **Fredericton**

- A **third student list** is provided as an Excel file for optional upload testing. Uploading this file requires **Composer**.

## Composer Dependency

The Excel upload functionality depends on composer (https://getcomposer.org/). 
More instructions for installing composer are available in documentation/Practicum-Tool - User Manual.docx
